## Whats In It

Varie bootstraps some defaults for you such as :

- Vuex
- Vue Router
- HTTP Request Services
- Inversify (IoC Container)

While we setup some of the defaults, these can be changed by the use
of [service providers](/docs/{{version}}/service-providers).

Whats the one of the greatest thing about Varie ? You can strip almost everything out
making your bundle size even smaller. You have a variety ways of building
your applications, your way.

## Why Use Varie ?

Things change over time, with javascript's ecosystem changing daily so should
the way you write things. With Varie you're able to focus on developing
skills that transfer across any project.

Or maybe you don't like how a framework made a certain choice for you and
you're unable to change it. Varie gives the power to the developer, free to
customize your application the way you need it. Don't like our validation system?
Throw it out, and put in your own validation system with a Service Provider!
